# How to Play Pisti



# How to Run Program
1. Start the server that will host the frontend UI.
 
Clone the repository and navigate to the folder using the command line. Then type the following and hit enter:

```python -m http.server```

2. Start the backend server that will coordinate the game.

Open another terminal window and navigate to the same folder. Then run the python file with:

```python app.py```

3. The game can now be accessed from a web browser.

If you are accessing the game from the same machine that the servers are running on, go to the following link:

[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

If you are accessing the game from another machine on the SAME local network, replace "localhost" with the IP address of the server. It will probably look something like the following:

http://192.168.X.X/8000/

If you do not know the IP address of the server, run "ipconfig" on the command line of the computer hosting the server.
   
5. Share the link for Player 2.

The first user to access the website is Player 1. Upon loading the page, a link for Player 2 is created. Share this link with Player 2 using an outside messaging service (email, SMS, etc.). 

6. Play the game

When Player 2 opens the link, the connection will be created and the game should begin. Have fun!
